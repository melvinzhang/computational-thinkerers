The participant arranges a 4x4 grid of black and white squares. Then point to
a position as the secret.

Assistant 1 may flip one square on the board from white to black or black to
white.

Assistant 2 looks at the resulting board and figures out where is the secret
position.

Assistant 1 can be replaced with a program. Same is true for any trick that
requires Assistant 1 to encode information, eg. the Magic Card Trick

Solution:
The parity of the board is a 4bit number by considering the following
partitions:
O X O X
O X O X
O X O X
O X O X

O O X X
O O X X
O O X X
O O X X

O O O O
X X X X
O O O O
X X X X

O O O O
O O O O
X X X X
X X X X

We can communicate the secret location by encoding it in the board parity.
initial board parity xor position to flip = secret position
initial board parity xor secret position = position to flip

initial board parity xor secret position can be computed in one step by
determining the board parity after flipping the secret position.

Assistant 2 computes the parity of the board and interprets that as a board
position.
