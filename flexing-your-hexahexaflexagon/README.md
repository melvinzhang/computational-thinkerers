Instructions
============
fold one of the corners up, to form a 60 degrees fold
  trick is to balance the folded section and open section
  we are trisecting the 90 degrees

fold it back on itself repeatedly to get 19 triangles

cut off the excess bits with scissors

left one blank, number 1,2,3, 1,2,3 until the last one
flip over, start number 4,4,5,5,6,6, least the last one blank

fold 4 to 4, 5 to 5, 6 to 6, so on

fold 2 to 2, 2 to 2, leaving all the same number on one side

then use double-sided tape to stick the two blank sides to each other

Sizing
======
For an equilaterial triangle

2 h = sqrt(3) a

where h is the altitude of the triangle
      a is the length of the side

The large version for demo
h = 10.5
a = 12.1

The small version for everyone to make
h = 2.3
a = 2.66

One A4 sheet of width 210mm makes 9 strips, 6 of width 23mm and 3 of width
24mm

Materials
=========
Large version
  six sheets of construction paper of different color
  each sheet cut into a large hexagon 
  glue to combine two sheets
  scotch tap to link the triangles
  alternative: print the booket on a large sheet of paper 

Small version
  white A4 100gsm paper
  cut into 6 x 2.3cm + 3 * 2.4 strips

Markers to draw on the small version

Scissors to trim the excess bits, cut strips

Double sided tap to tape the ends together

Writing material to mark the triangles for folding
