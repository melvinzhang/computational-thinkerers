# Computational Thinkerers at Maker Faire SG 2017, Singpore Science Centre, Hall A

## Who are Computational Thinkerers?

Computational Thinkerer is a mash-up of computational thinking and tinkering.
Computational Thinking is increasingly called the fourth R, in tandem with the
current 3R (Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic). Experience CT through a series
of FUN tinkering activities, including: (a) Bill Gates and Pancake Flipping,
(b) Reading your Mind with MatheMAGIC, and (c) Finding your Flip Magic.

## Workshop on Computational Thinking: A Gentle Introduction to CT
### July 23 (Sunday), 12.45 to 2.15pm

Computational Thinking has been said to be the fourth R, in
tandem with the current 3R (Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic).
And many have recognized the importance of CT as a life skill
for all in the 21st century and beyond.

In this workshop, we will give a gentle introduction to CT via
three fun and thought-provoking hands-on activities that expose
participants to the FUN and the thinking processes behind CT.

These activities include some of the following:
  * Bill Gates and Pancake Flipping (introduction to algorithms!)
  * Reading your Mind with MatheMAGIC,
  * Finding your Flip Magic

The workshop will close with reflections on how these activities
link to real-life problem solving in computer science and everyday
things in our lives.

"Come with an open mind and a questioning attitude."
