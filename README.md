Our Tampines Hub (Community Auditorium) Fri to Sun, Aug 17-19, 2018

## Who are Computational Thinkerers?

Computational Thinkerer is a mash-up of computational thinking and tinkering.
Computational Thinking is increasingly called the fourth R, in tandem with the
current 3R (Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic). Experience CT through a series
of FUN tinkering activities, including: (a) Bill Gates and Pancake Flipping,
(b) Reading your Mind with MatheMAGIC, and (c) Finding your Flip Magic.

## Workshop on Computational Thinking: A Gentle Introduction to CT
### August 19 (Sunday), 1pm to 2:30pm

Computational Thinking has been said to be the fourth R, in
tandem with the current 3R (Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic).
And many have recognized the importance of CT as a life skill
for all in the 21st century and beyond.

In this workshop, we will give a gentle introduction to CT via
three fun and thought-provoking hands-on activities that expose
participants to the FUN and the thinking processes behind CT.

These activities include some of the following:
  * Bill Gates and Pancake Flipping (introduction to algorithms!)
  * Reading your Mind with MatheMAGIC,
  * Finding your Flip Magic

The workshop will close with reflections on how these activities
link to real-life problem solving in computer science and everyday
things in our lives.

"Come with an open mind and a questioning attitude."
