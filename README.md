# Computational Thinkerers at Maker Faire Singapore 2016

Computational Thinkerer is a mash-up of computational thinking and tinkering.
Computational Thinking is increasingly called the fourth R, in tandem with the
current 3R (Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic). Experience CT through a series
of FUN tinkering activities, including: (a) Bill Gates and Pancake Flipping,
(b) Reading your Mind with MatheMAGIC, and (c) Finding your Flip Magic.
